                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>For Assignment 2, we created a map application that sent the client's current location to a server, and received a JSON of all check-ins to the server. The page would then create a map of all of the locations and calculate the distance from the user.</p>
                <p>In Assignment 3, we then recreated the server. We created an API that would accept the locations, store them in a MongoDB database, and could respond to external requests. This relied on enabling CORS and setting up a web database server</p>
                <p>Finally, I was "hired" to test the security of Zabir's application, breaking the app if need be. I am looking for all security vulnerabilities that I can find and then suggesting solutions for those problems.</p>

        <div class="box">
                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>I performed a two step analysis of the application. First was a black-box attempt to breach the security of the server and webpage. Second, I examined the source code for the server and page.</p>
                <p>The two main tools I used to examine the security of the application were:</p>
                <ul>
                        <li><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm?hl=en">Postman</a></li>
                        <li><a href="http://www.portswigger.net/burp/">Burp Suite</a></li>
