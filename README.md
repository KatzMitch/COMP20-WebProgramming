Lab 9: Finalizing Portfolio

This Git repo is a collection of (most of) my work from COMP20: Web
Programming, which I took Spring Semester 2015.

My favorite assignment was Assignment 3: creating a web server. I like it
because I am more interested overall in back-end and server side developemnt.
As nice as it is to create the final product, like we did in Assignment 2, I
think I enjoy making the reusable (or mostly reusable) tools more, like the
server.

I am really impressed with how much I have learned over the course of the
semester. I have learned several programming languages and frameworks, and I
am very happy with my level of fluency with all of them.

Overall, I think the most important things I've learned in this course are the
idea of first class functions in JavaScript, as it is a programming paradigm
that I am sure to use throughout my career, and the basics of Web Security,
again, just an incredibly useful topic for software developers.

I would like to learn more about web security as, like I said, it is something
that all software developers need to understand. Because of that, I am taking
the security course next fall! (See you there Ming!)
