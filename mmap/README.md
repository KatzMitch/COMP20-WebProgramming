COMP20: Web Programming
Assignment 2: Marauders Map


I believe I have now correctly implemented the whole assignment, except that my
map does not zoom currently. I did not collaborate with anyone about the
assignment, but thanks to Andrew Stephens for helping me figure out my issue
launching the Python Simple HTTP Server (I didn't realize that the folder I 
ran the command from became localhost, I thought it defaulted to the root).
Unfortunately, he showed me this right before I finished, so I committed an
insane amount to be able to test it... sorry!

This project took me a total of about 5 hours!
